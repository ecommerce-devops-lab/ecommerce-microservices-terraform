# GCP-Implemented Design Patterns

This document describes the design patterns implemented in our ecommerce microservices architecture using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) native services.

## 1. Auto-scaling Pattern

### Purpose

The Auto-scaling pattern allows the infrastructure to automatically adjust based on demand, ensuring system availability and optimal performance.

### Implementation

Implemented in the GKE node pool with the following features:

```hcl
autoscaling {
  min_node_count = 1
  max_node_count = 3
  location_policy = "BALANCED"
}
```

### Benefits

- Automatic scaling based on load
- Cost optimization by scaling down when there's no demand
- High availability by maintaining minimum nodes
- Balanced resource distribution

### Integration with Microservices

- Applies to all microservices deployed in the cluster
- Affects: user-service, product-service, order-service, payment-service, shipping-service, favourite-service
- Allows each service to scale independently based on its load

## 2. Scheduled Maintenance Pattern

### Purpose

The Scheduled Maintenance pattern enables system updates and maintenance at specific times, minimizing impact on users.

### Implementation

Configured in the GKE cluster:

```hcl
maintenance_policy {
  recurring_window {
    start_time = "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    end_time   = "2024-01-01T04:00:00Z"
    recurrence = "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA,SU"
  }
}
```

### Benefits

- Predictable maintenance windows
- Controlled updates
- Minimized user impact
- Better resource planning

### Integration with Microservices

- Affects all microservices in a coordinated manner
- Enables simultaneous updates of multiple services
- Maintains version consistency across services

## 3. Monitoring and Observability Pattern

### Purpose

The Monitoring and Observability pattern provides visibility into system state and performance, enabling early problem detection.

### Implementation

Implemented using Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging:

```hcl
# Health monitoring
resource "google_monitoring_uptime_check_config" "cluster_health" {
  display_name = "GKE Cluster Health Check"
  timeout      = "10s"
  http_check {
    port = 443
    use_ssl = true
    path = "/healthz"
  }
}

# Logging metrics
resource "google_logging_metric" "cluster_errors" {
  name        = "gke-cluster-errors"
  description = "GKE Cluster Error Logs"
  filter      = "resource.type=\"k8s_cluster\" AND severity>=ERROR"
}
```

### Benefits

- Early problem detection
- Real-time metrics
- Centralized logging
- Configurable alerts
- Performance analysis

### Integration with Microservices

- Unified monitoring of all microservices
- Service-specific metrics
- Centralized logs for debugging
- Configurable alerts per service

## 4. Gradual Update Pattern

### Purpose

The Gradual Update pattern allows service updates without downtime, maintaining system availability.

### Implementation

Configured in the node pool:

```hcl
upgrade_settings {
  max_surge       = 1
  max_unavailable = 0
}
```

### Benefits

- Updates without downtime
- Automatic rollback in case of failures
- Control over the update process
- Risk minimization

### Integration with Microservices

- Enables gradual updates of each microservice
- Maintains service compatibility
- Facilitates testing of new versions

## Implementation Considerations

### Service Dependencies

- Microservices maintain their independence
- Service communication through API Gateway
- Service Discovery enables dynamic service location

### Scalability

- Each microservice can scale independently
- Auto-scaling applies at node level
- Load is automatically distributed

### Monitoring

- Metrics available in Cloud Monitoring
- Centralized logs in Cloud Logging
- Configurable alerts per service

### Maintenance

- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Gradual updates
- Automatic rollback in case of failures
