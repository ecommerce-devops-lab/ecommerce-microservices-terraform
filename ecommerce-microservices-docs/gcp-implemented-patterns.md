# GCP-Implemented Design Patterns

This document describes the design patterns implemented using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) native services in our ecommerce microservices architecture.

## 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern

### Purpose

The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents cascading failures in distributed systems by monitoring for failures and stopping the flow of requests when a service is likely to fail.

### Implementation

Implemented using Cloud Endpoints with the following features:

- Automatic retry on 5xx errors
- Circuit breaker configuration with:
  - Maximum requests: 100
  - Maximum requests per connection: 10
  - Maximum connections: 100
  - Maximum pending requests: 100
  - Maximum retries: 3

### Benefits

- Prevents cascading failures
- Reduces load on failing services
- Automatic recovery when service becomes healthy
- Native integration with GCP monitoring

## 2. External Configuration Pattern

### Purpose

The External Configuration pattern separates configuration from code, allowing for dynamic updates without redeployment and secure management of sensitive information.

### Implementation

Implemented using GCP Secret Manager with:

- Automatic replication for high availability
- JSON-based configuration structure
- Service-specific configurations
- Secure storage of sensitive data

### Benefits

- Centralized configuration management
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Version control for configurations
- Dynamic updates without redeployment
- Integration with GCP IAM for access control

## 3. Bulkhead Pattern

### Purpose

The Bulkhead pattern isolates elements of an application into pools to prevent cascading failures and ensure system stability under load.

### Implementation

Implemented using:

- Cloud Load Balancing for request distribution
- Autoscaling with:
  - Minimum replicas: 2
  - Maximum replicas: 10
  - CPU utilization target: 70%
  - Load balancing utilization target: 70%
  - Cooldown period: 60 seconds

### Benefits

- Automatic scaling based on load
- Resource isolation
- Improved system stability
- Better resource utilization
- Native integration with GCP monitoring

## Validation and Testing

### Circuit Breaker Validation

1. Monitor the Cloud Endpoints dashboard
2. Simulate service failures
3. Verify retry behavior
4. Check circuit breaker state changes

### External Configuration Validation

1. Update configurations in Secret Manager
2. Verify service picks up new configurations
3. Test secret rotation
4. Validate access controls

### Bulkhead Validation

1. Perform load testing
2. Monitor autoscaling behavior
3. Verify resource isolation
4. Check load distribution

## Monitoring and Maintenance

All patterns are integrated with:

- Cloud Monitoring for metrics
- Cloud Logging for logs
- Cloud Trace for distributed tracing
- Cloud Profiler for performance analysis
